                                 MIF Doclet

                                 Version C

      Disclaimer - The MIF Doclet is experimental code developed for
      internal use at Sun and released to the developer community for 
      us as-is. It is not a supported product.  Use at your own risk. 
      While we have worked to make it useful, bugs might not be fixed 
      and features might not be added. It might not be updated, and 
      might be re-released with a different implementation or GUI design 
      that is incompatible with the current design.


The MIF doclet is an extension of Javadoc that generates API documentation 
in MIF (Maker Interchange Format).  It generates these docs from declarations 
and doc comments in source code written in the Java(TM) programming language.  
These MIF documents can then be opened in Adobe FrameMaker and optionally 
converted to PDF, PS, Microsoft RTF, Microsoft Word or WordPerfect.

Version C of the MIF Doclet works with version 1.2 or later of the Java 2 SDK,
Standard Edition.

The download bundle uncompresses to a directory named "mifdoclet_X" (where
"X" is the version number -- for example, for version C it is "mifdoclet_").
This directory contains these files:
