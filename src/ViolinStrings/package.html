String manipulation functions you ever missed in Java. Version 0.9. 136 functions in total. And it's free. 
It provides a "Strings" class which comprises all the manipulation and test functions usually to be found in other
common string classes like those known from C++. The functions themselves are static methods of the "Strings" class. You do not have to change your normal
Java strings or replace the Java String class with another class.
