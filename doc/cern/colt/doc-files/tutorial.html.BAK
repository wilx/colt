<BR>JAX is a Java program packaging tool that reduces the program's size.
It works by analyzing a Java program, extracting the essential artifacts
out of it, applying some optimizations that reduce space overhead, and
then compressing what is left. An estimated 30-90% reduction of the original
program size is currently feasible with JAX. In addition, a JAXed Java
program is also obfuscated. Obfuscation makes the reconstruction of source
code from byte codes difficult.
<P>There are two ways to Jax a Java program. JAX can be run as a command-line
(batch) tool. We also provide an experimental Graphical User Interface
(GUI) . Please note that the <B>GUI is supported only for JDK1.1.7 or earlier
JDK releases.</B>
<BR>We will explain the both in detail.
